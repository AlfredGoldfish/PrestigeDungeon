# Development Notes

This file can be used to jot down implementation ideas, design discussions, or TODO items as you flesh out the prestige dungeon. Since the current repository is a scaffold only, you may add your own notes here about how to connect systems, implement algorithms, or integrate thirdâ€‘party libraries in the future.
